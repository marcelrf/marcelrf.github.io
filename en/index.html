Of course, you people have long ago kicked out all the alien invaders, defeated the dark overlord, and reduced the usual zombie swarms. So, now, you sword-fight just for fun: Between sessions at school or work; while waiting at the traffic light; or even in the elevator (if it's not too small)."

Are you up to the challenge?"
